\section{About}
\label{about}
\subsection{About FreeCol}
\label{about_freecol}
The FreeCol team aims to create an Open Source version of
Colonization (released under the
\href{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html}{GPL}). At
first we'll try to make an exact clone of Colonization. The visuals
will be brought up to date with more recent standards but will remain
clean, simple and functional. Certain new 'features' will be
implemented but the gameplay and the rules will be exactly the same as
the original game. Examples of modern features are: an isometric map
and multiplayer support.

This clone will be developed incrementally and result in
\textbf{FreeCol 1.0.0 which will be an almost exact Colonization
clone}. Incremental development basically means that we'll add
features one at a time. This allows us to have a running program at
all times and also to release an unfinished but working game once in a
while.

Once FreeCol 1.0.0 is finished we'll start working towards FreeCol
2.0.0. \textbf{FreeCol 2 will go beyond the original Colonization} and
will have many new features, it will be an implementation of our (and
our users') image of what Colonization 2 would have been.

\subsection{The Original Colonization}
\label{original_col}
The original Colonization was released in 1994 by Microprose.
\textbf{Colonization is heavily based on Civilization} which is
generally considered to be the best turn-based strategy game for the
PC in the history of mankind.

In Civilization the object of the game was to build a nation that
could stand the test of times and that could also do one of the
following: conquer the world or be the first to launch a
spaceship. In Colonization things are bit different...

A Colonization game starts in 1492 and \textbf{the object of the game
is to colonize America}. You begin the game with one vessel and two
colonists.

As in Civilization you need to build a powerful nation, but
fortunately in the early part of the game \textbf{you'll be able to
send ships back to Europe} in order to sell the goods you've produced
or to bring back some colonists. \textbf{Getting colonists into the
new world is a very important aspect of the game} as one game turn
takes one year and later on even one season and as a result colonies
don't grow as rapidly as they do in Civilization. You can pay
colonists to come to the new world or you can show off with the
religious freedom of your people in which case they will hop on your
vessels for no money at all.

Another important aspect is \textbf{trade: the source of all income}
(apart from Inca and Aztec gold). In a land filled with precious
resources it is important to \textbf{build your colonies at the right
location} and to place crafstmen where they belong. This is not only
to have an income but also to be able to \textbf{live off the land}
when you can no longer count on the support of Europe.

Through all this you'll have to decide whether or not you want to
\textbf{live next to the native americans} peacefully. They can teach
your colonists new skills that cannot be tought anywhere else and they
will offer you goods in case you choose to treat them as your
friends. On the other hand, their villages can be attacked and their
valuable goods can be taken from them and sold in Europe.

\textbf{Other European forces are also busy occupying their piece of
the new world}. Should their borders go too far then take over some
of their colonies by force because they wouldn't hesitate to do the
same thing to you.

The object of Colonization is to \textbf{declare your independence and
survive an attack of the King's forces}. Before declaring your
independence \textbf{you need to have the majority of the people
behind you}. This can be done by \textbf{promoting free speech} and by
providing a strong governmental system.

\section{Installation}
\label{installation}
To compile FreeCol you'll need Java and the Ant program. Ant can be
found at \href{Ant homepage}{http://ant.apache.org/}.

When these are installed, go to the root directory of FreeCol and type
\verb$ant$ to build a JAR file containing the game. The game is
started using the command \verb$java -jar FreeCol.jar$.  If something
goes wrong, send a bug report at the
\href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/freecol}{SourceForge page of
FreeCol}.

\section{Interface}
\label{interface}
This section will provide information about the keyboard shortcuts and
the different actions that can be used in the game.

\subsection{The main screen}
\label{main_screen}
The figure \ref{main_screen_fig} represents the main screen.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/main_screen.png}
    \caption{The main screen.\label{main_screen_fig}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The units, colonies, and so forth can be seen on the main screen. You
can change the currently selected unit by clicking on any other
unit. You can move the currently selected unit using the numeric
keypad. If you select a unit with the left mouse button and drag the
mouse, the main screen will display the best path from the unit's
current position to the tile the mouse is hovering over. The path
consists of green and red dots, indicating whether the tiles can be
reached during this turn or not. Once you release the mouse button,
the selected unit will begin to follow this path. It will awake once
it has arrived at its destination or if it can no longer follow the
path (if an enemy unit is in the way, for instance).

If you right click on a tile containing neither units nor settlements,
a popup window will show you some information about the goods that can
be produced on this tile (unless the tile has not yet been explored,
in which case nothing will happen). If the tile contains units or
settlements, you will be presented with a menu from which you can
select the units or the settlement present, or the tile information.

The following shortcuts are also available:
\begin{itemize}
\item\verb$b$: build a colony.
\item\verb$c$: center on the currently selected unit.
\item\verb$d$: disband the active unit.
\item\verb$e$: show the Europe panel.
\item\verb$f$: fortify.
\item\verb$g$: goto selected destination.
\item\verb$p$: plow the current tile.
\item\verb$r$: build a road on the current tile.
\item\verb$s$: sentry.
\item\verb$w$: wait.
\item\verb$space$: skip for this turn.
\item\verb$enter$: end the turn.
\item\verb$plus$ or \verb$equals$: zoom in.
\item\verb$minus$ or \verb$underscore$: zoom out.
\item\verb$ctrl-d$: display tile names.
\item\verb$ctrl-g$: display grid.
\item\verb$ctrl-m$: show/hide the map controls.
\item\verb$ctrl-n$: new game.
\item\verb$ctrl-o$: open a game.
\item\verb$ctrl-q$: quit the game.
\item\verb$ctrl-r$: reconnect.
\item\verb$ctrl-s$: save a game.
\item\verb$ctrl-t$: show the chat panel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Europe panel}
\label{europe_panel}
The figure \ref{europe_panel_fig} represents the Europe panel.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/europe_panel.png}
    \caption{The Europe Panel.\label{europe_panel_fig}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In this panel, you can control the ships embarked for America or Europe,
and the ships currently stationed in Europe. You can also buy goods,
recruit, purchase and train units. Units recruited, purchased or trained
are in the «Docks» area in the Europe panel.

If a ship has set sail for Europe or America, you can change its
direction by dragging it from the «Going to America» box to the «Going
to Europe» box (or vice versa).

Ships that are docked at the European port can also do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Embark/Disembark units: drag and drop between the «Docks»
  and «Cargo» sections of the Europe panel.
\item Sell/Buy goods: drag and drop between the «Cargo» panel and the
  «Market» panel. If you want to sell only a part of your cargo, or
  want to buy less than 100 units of goods, press the shift key while
  dragging. This will allow you to specify how many units you wish to
  transfer. If any of the goods are displayed in grey, this means they
  are being boycotted by the Crown because you refused a tax
  raise. You must pay your tax arrears before you can trade these
  goods. You can do this by dragging the goods as usual, in which case
  you will be given the chance to pay your tax arrears (provided you
  have enough money).
\item Arm/Mount/Equip with tools/Dress as missionaries a unit: 
  right click on the unit.
\item Move your ship to the «Going to America» section of the Europe
  panel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Colony panel}
\label{colony_panel}
The figure \ref{colony_panel_fig} represents the Colony panel.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/colony_panel.png}
    \caption{The Colony Panel.\label{colony_panel_fig}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To view a colony's panel, left click on it from the main
screen. From this panel, colonist's cultivation, production, and other
tasks can be assigned:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cultivation: Drop the unit onto the appropriate plot of land in
  the colony. You can change what a colonist cultivate by right
  clicking on it. Note that your colonists can not go fishing on ocean
  tiles before they have built a dock.
\item Production: Drop the unit onto the relevant «Buildings».
\item Depart colony: Drop the unit onto the colony's gate.
\item Embark on a ship: If there is a ship in port, you can embark
  your colonist on it by dropping it onto the «Cargo» section of the
  colony panel.
\item Build a building: Drop the unit onto the carpenter's house and
  select the building you want from the building menu.
\end{itemize}

You can also load cargo into a ship's hold by dropping the goods onto
the ship or the specific hold within the ship. Use the shift key while
dropping it if you want to load only a portion of the goods.

\section{Colonies}

\subsection{Picking a suitable site}

Your colonies are your most important assets in the new world.
Therefore, it is very important to build them in the right
place. There are several aspects to consider:

\subsubsection{The colony tile}

Some terrain types are more suitable for establishing a colony than
others. Colonies can not be built on arctic tiles, nor on
mountains. Hills and deserts are less suitable than other tiles
because they produce less food, which is very important in the long
run. Tiles with forest generally produce less food than tiles without,
but pioneers are able to cut down the forest and plow the tile, which
will increase food production. The presence of a river will also
increase food production.

\subsubsection{The adjacent tiles}

In the early stages of the game, you will need to generate cash by
selling products from the New World in your Home Port. Thus, many of
your early colonies should probably be situated next to bonus tiles,
which greatly increase production. Rivers also increase production,
though not as much as a bonus resource. On the other hand, they
increase the production of many different kinds of goods, unlike a
bonus resource.

In order to improve your colony, you will have to construct various
buildings. This will require large amounts of lumber. For this reason,
you should make sure that at least one tile adjacent to your colony
site can produce sufficient amounts of lumber. You will also need
tools to construct advanced buildings. Therefore, it is an advantage
if the colony can also produce ore, which can be refined to produce
tools. However, ore is not as important as lumber.

Some of the tiles may be owned by other European powers, or claimed by
Indians. Building a colony too close to other settlements is not a
good idea, unless you plan to conquer or destroy these settlements.
Keeping your own colonies close together is a good strategy, however,
as long as you avoid sharing tiles between several colonies as far as
possible.

\subsubsection{No Reforestation}

You can order your pioneers to cut down forests by plowing a tile.
This will increase the food produced on these tiles, and the lumber
will be delivered to your colonies. However, you can not plant new
forests later. Once cleared, a tile will never produce lumber again.

\subsection{Colony buildings}

A newly established colony already includes several buildings, namely
a town hall, a carpenter's house, a blacksmith's house, a
tobacconist's house, a weaver's house, a distiller's house, a fur
trader's house, and a warehouse. You can improve your colonies by
upgrading these buildings, except the town hall, and by constructing
various new buildings.

The craftsmen's houses can be upgraded to workshops and then to
factories (after Adam Smith has joined the Continental Congress),
which can produce more manufactured goods. While the town hall itself
can not be upgraded, its effect, namely the production of Liberty
Bells, can be boosted by constructing a printing press and then a
newspaper.

All in all, there are sixteen different buildings, eight of which are
immediately present in a newly established colony:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Town Hall}, which can not be upgraded, provides
  workplaces for up to three colonists producing \textbf{Liberty
  Bells}. Its effect can be increased by building a \textbf{Printing
  Press} and a \textbf{Newspaper}.

\item The \textbf{Carpenter's House}, which can be upgraded to a
  \textbf{Lumber Mill}, is used to convert \textbf{Lumber} to
  \textbf{Hammers}. Hammers are required to construct or upgrade all
  kinds of buildings.

\item The \textbf{Blacksmith's House}, which can be upgraded to a
  \textbf{Blacksmith's Workshop} and then to \textbf{Iron Works}, is
  used to convert \textbf{Ore} to \textbf{Tools}. Tools are required
  to construct certain kinds of buildings and to upgrade all kinds of
  buildings. Tools are also used by \textbf{Pioneers} and to produce
  \textbf{Muskets}.

\item The \textbf{Tobacconist's House}, which can be upgraded to a
  \textbf{Tobacconist's Shop} and then to a \textbf{Cigar Factory}, is
  used to produce \textbf{Cigars} from \textbf{Tobacco}.

\item The \textbf{Weaver's House}, which can be upgraded to a
  \textbf{Weaver's Shop} and then to a \textbf{Textile Mill}, is used
  to turn \textbf{Cotton} into \textbf{Cloth}.

\item The \textbf{Fur Trader's House}, which can be upgraded to a
  \textbf{Fur Trader's Post} and then to a \textbf{Fur Factory}, is
  used to produce \textbf{Coats} from \textbf{Fur}.

\item The \textbf{Distiller's House}, which can be upgraded to a
  \textbf{Rum Distillery} and then to a \textbf{Rum Factory}, is used
  to produce \textbf{Rum} from \textbf{Sugar}.

\item The \textbf{Warehouse} stores all kinds of goods. Its initial
  capacity is 100 units of each kind of goods, but it can be upgraded
  to 200 and finally 300 units.
\end{itemize}

The following eight buildings are not available for free and have to
be constructed later:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Schoolhouse}


                            SCHOOLHOUSE = 7, //10
                            ARMORY = 8,
                            CHURCH = 9, //13
                            STOCKADE = 10, //7
                            WAREHOUSE = 11,
                            STABLES = 12,
                            DOCK = 13, //9
                            PRINTING_PRESS = 14,
                            CUSTOM_HOUSE = 15;

\end{itemize}
