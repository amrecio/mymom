\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
Welcome to FreeCol! If you're interested in development of
this program, please see the \htmladdnormallink{FreeCol web
  site}{http://freecol.sourceforge.net}. This is a draft version of
the user's guide. You can find the latest version at the 
\htmladdnormallink{FreeCol
  homepage}{http://freecol.sourceforge.net}.\\

\section{About}
\label{about}
\subsection{About FreeCol}
\label{about_freecol}
The FreeCol team aims to create an Open Source version of
Colonization (released under the
\htmladdnormallink{GPL}{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html}). At
first we'll try to make an exact clone of Colonization. The visuals
will be brought up to date with more recent standards but will remain
clean, simple and functional. Certain new 'features' will be
implemented but the gameplay and the rules will be exactly the same as
the original game. Examples of modern features are: an isometric map
and multiplayer support.\\

This clone will be developed incrementally and result in
\textbf{FreeCol 1.0.0 which will be an almost exact Colonization
  clone}. Incremental development basically means that we'll add
features one at a time. This allows us to have a running program at
all times and also to release an unfinished but working game once in a
while.\\

Once FreeCol 1.0.0 is finished we'll start working towards FreeCol
2.0.0. \textbf{FreeCol 2 will go beyond the original Colonization} and
will have many new features, it will be an implementation of our (and
our users') image of what Colonization 2 would have been.

\subsection{The Original Colonization}
\label{original_col}
The original Colonization was released in 1994 by
Microprose. \textbf{Colonization is heavily based on Civilization}
which is generally considered to be the best turn-based strategy game
for the PC in the history of mankind.\\

In Civilization the object of the game was to build a nation that
could stand the test of times and that could also do one of the
following: conquer the world or be the first to launch a
spaceship. In Colonization things are bit different...\\

A Colonization game starts in 1492 and \textbf{the object of the game
  is to colonize America}. You begin the game with one vessel and two
colonists.\\

As in Civilization you need to build a powerful nation, but
fortunately in the early part of the game \textbf{you'll be able to
  send ships back to Europe} in order to sell the goods you've
produced or to bring back some colonists. \textbf{Getting colonists
  into the new world is a very important aspect of the game} as one
game turn takes one year and later on even one season and as a result
colonies don't grow as rapidly as they do in Civilization. You can pay
colonists to come to the new world or you can show off with the
religious freedom of your people in which case they will hop on your
vessels for no money at all.\\

Another important aspect is \textbf{trade: the source of all income}
(apart from Inca and Aztec gold). In a land filled with precious
resources it is important to \textbf{build your colonies at the right
  location} and to place crafstmen where they belong. This is not only
to have an income but also to be able to \textbf{live off the land}
when you can no longer count on the support of Europe.\\

Through all this you'll have to decide whether or not you want to
\textbf{live next to the native americans} peacefully. They can teach
your colonists new skills that cannot be tought anywhere else and they
will offer you goods in case you choose to treat them as your
friends. On the other hand, their villages can be attacked and their
valuable goods can be taken from them and sold in Europe.\\

\textbf{Other Eurpean forces are also busy occupying their piece of
  the new world}. Should their borders go too far then take over some
of their colonies by force because they wouldn't hesitate to do the
same thing to you.\\

The object of Colonization is to \textbf{declare your indepence and
  survive an attack of the King's forces}. Before declaring your
independence \textbf{you need to have the majority of the people
  behind you}. This can be done by \textbf{promoting free speech} and
by providing a strong governmental system.

\section{Installation}
\label{installation}
To compile FreeCol you'll need Java and the Ant program. Ant can be
found at \htmladdnormallink{Ant homepage}{http://ant.apache.org/}.\\

When these are installed, go to the root directory of
FreeCol and type \verb$ant$ to build a JAR file containing the
game. The game is started using the command \verb$java -jar FreeCol.jar$.
If something goes wrong, send a bug report at the
\htmladdnormallink{SourceForge page of
  FreeCol}{http://sourceforge.net/projects/freecol}.

\section{Interface}
\label{interface}
This section will provide information about the keyboard shortcuts and
the different actions that can be used in the game.

\subsection{The main screen}
\label{main_screen}
The figure \ref{main_screen_fig} represents the main screen.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.975]{images/main_screen.png}
    \caption{The main screen.\label{main_screen_fig}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The units, colonies, and so forth can be seen on the main screen. You
can move the currently selected unit using the numeric keypad. You can
change the currently selected unit by clicking on any other unit. If
you right click on a tile, you can see the different units that are on
this tile.\\

\subsection{The Europe panel}
\label{europe_panel}
The figure \ref{europe_panel_fig} represents the Europe panel.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.975]{images/europe_panel.png}
    \caption{The Europe Panel.\label{europe_panel_fig}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In this panel, you can control the ships embarked for America or Europe,
and the ships currently stationed in Europe. You can also buy goods,
recruit, purchase and train units. Units recruited, purchased or trained
are in the «Docks» area in the Europe panel.\\

If a ship has set sail for Europe or America, you can change its
direction.\\

Ships that are docked at the European port can also do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Embark/Disembark units: drag and drop between the «Docks»
  and «Cargo» sections of the Europe panel.
\item Sell/Buy goods: drag and drop between the «Cargo» part of
  the Europe panel and the part of the Europe panel where all the
  goods are listed. If you want to sell/buy only a part of a type of
  goods, use the shift key while dropping it.
\item Arm/Mount/Equip with tools/Dress as missionaries a unit: 
  right click on the unit.
\item Move your ship to the «Going to America» section of the Europe
  panel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Colony panel}
\label{colony_panel}
The figure \ref{colony_panel_fig} represents the Colony panel.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.975]{images/colony_panel.png}
    \caption{The Colony Panel.\label{colony_panel_fig}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To view a colony's panel, left click on it from the main
screen. From this panel, colonist's cultivation, production, and other
tasks can be assigned:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cultivation: Drop the unit onto the appropriate plot of land in
  the colony. You can change what a colonist cultivate by right
  clicking on it.
\item Production: Drop the unit onto the relevant «Buildings».
\item Depart colony: Drop the unit onto the colony's gate.
\item Embark on a ship: If there is a ship in port, you can embark
  your colonist on it by dropping it onto the «Cargo» section of the
  colony panel.
\end{itemize}

You can also load cargo into a ship's hold by dropping the goods onto
the ship or the specific hold within the ship. Use the shift key while
dropping it if you want to load only a portion of the goods.
