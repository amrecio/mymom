model.tile.plains.description=Plains are large areas of land with relatively low relief, more suitable for farming. They produce a great deal of Grain, a lesser amount of Cotton, and some Ore. They are found in the temperate regions.
model.tile.grassland.description=Grasslands are open, continuous flat areas of grass. They are often located near temperate forests in high areas or deserts in subtropical areas. Grasslands are ideal for growing tobacco. Food can be grown as well.
model.tile.prairie.description=Prairie is an area of land that supports grasses and herbs, with few trees, and having generally a moderate or temperate climate. Prairies are most suitable for cultivating Grain and Cotton.
model.tile.savannah.description=In savannahs, grasses and trees are co-dominant vegetation types. Savannahs are frequently seen as a transitional zone, occurring between forest or woodland regions and grassland or desert regions. Savannah produces mainly Grain and Sugar.
model.tile.marsh.description=Marsh is a type of wetland, featuring grasses, rushes, reeds, typha, sedges, and other herbaceous plants in a context of shallow water. Marsh produces some Grain and Tobacco, as well as Ore. Marshes are mainly found in the high latitudes.
model.tile.swamp.description=Tropical wetlands by shallow bodies of water. Swamps have a greater proportion of open water surface and generally deeper than marshes. Swamp yields some Grain, as well as small amounts of Sugar and Ore.
model.tile.desert.description=Deserts are very dry, they receive minimal precipitation. Though scarce, deserts produce Grain, Cotton and Ore.
model.tile.tundra.description=Tundra is an area where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. Tundra produces Grain and some Ore. It is found in the high latitudes.
model.tile.mixedForest.description=Mixed forests, which can be found in the temperate latitudes, produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Cotton. If mixed forests are cleared, they become plains.
model.tile.coniferForest.description=Conifer forests produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Tobacco. They are found mainly in the tropical latitudes and give way to grassland when cleared.
model.tile.broadleafForest.description=Broadleaf forests produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Cotton. They are found in the temperate latitudes and give way to prairies when cleared.
model.tile.tropicalForest.description=Tropical forests produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Sugar. Clearing tropical forests produces savannah.
model.tile.wetlandForest.description=Wetland forests produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Ore. Wetland forests can be cleared to produce marsh land. They are found in the high latitudes.
model.tile.rainForest.description=Rain forests produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Ore, Sugar and Tobacco. They are found in the tropics and can be cleared to produce swamps.
model.tile.scrubForest.description=Scrub forests produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Cotton and Ore. If they are cleared, the land becomes a desert. Scrub forests are found in temperate regions.
model.tile.borealForest.description=Boreal forests produce Grain, Lumber, Furs, and some Ore. They are found in the high latitudes and can be cleared to produce tundra.
model.tile.arctic.description=Arctic is mostly a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless, frozen ground and produce nothing. They are found near the North and South Pole and can not support colonies.
model.tile.ocean.description=Oceans are major bodies of saline water, good for fishing. The amount of fish is increased by the presence of land and especially by river mouths.
model.tile.highSeas.description=High seas produce Fish. They also enable your ships to sail to and from Europe.
model.tile.hills.description=Hills extend above the surrounding terrain, in a limited area. Hills produce a large amount of Ore, as well as some Grain.
model.tile.mountains.description=Mountains extend above the surrounding terrain in a limited area. Mountains are generally steeper than hills. They are difficult to travel and colonies cannot be founded here. However mining proves useful for ore and silver extraction.
model.tile.greatRiver.description=Great rivers are rivers that can be navigated by ships.
model.tile.lake.description=Lakes are inland bodies of water. Colonies built adjacently profit from the lakes natural resources, but may be inaccessible via ship.

# American culture to sort things out.
# In each case I have tried to pick a prominent place for a capital, and ordered the
# rest in the following categories:
#   prominent settlements
#   settlements
#   place names
#   names in the language
#   words in the language.
# The code chooses randomly from the list (apart from the capital), but this should
# cease once the list is expertly edited and arranged in a sensible order.

# Apache
# Hard to find place names, and the Apache languages are tonal so the transliteration
# was particularly brutal.  The following are just names, often of tribes,
# not place names.  The capital is the name of a tribe and a prosperous reservation.
